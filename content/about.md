![Christopher Foy](/images/about_me.jpg)

I'm a software developer who's been writing, deploying, and maintaining
web applications and services for 7 years. I have a Diploma in Software
Engineering from Mohawk College, a BA (Hon.) in English from Dalhousie,
and a BA in Classical Studies from the University of Ottawa. What can
I say? I like to learn.

I live in Hamilton, Ontario with my wife, Jessica, where I enjoy making
pizza from scratch, catching wild Pok√©mon, and reading, especially 
young adult vampire fiction and chefs' memoirs. I'm also a big CBC
Radio fan, particularly [Under the Influence](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence).
